## Final Game

A new menu to select levels or play the game from start to finish (5 levels and a boss). A* implemented for enemy movement. Game tuned to be more balanced from start to finish.

## Beta Instructions

See controls from Alpha. Keys are new, lots of sounds and some animations, additional levels, dialogue-collision objects, potions, and sawblades. You can stop a sawblade with a spider, which slows enemies. There are also states that can exist on the Biomancer, enemies, and animals such as slow, burn, poison, etc. Also, there are animal interactions when wolves attack turtles. This forces players to not use the wolf to attack nearby enemies while also trying to blow up rock walls.

## Alpha Instructions

Walk around with arrow keys, launch animals with space bar, and use the number keys 1-4 to switch animals. We have two levels, several enemies, different animal types, and a level editor (editor.html). If you need to get through a rock wall, try blowing it up with a turtle. Thanks for playing!

## Lab 9

We have a level editor, more animals, and rock walls that can be blown up by turtles. Number keys 1-4 for animals.

## Lab 8

We decide a alpha

## Lab 7

## Lab 6

## Lab 4

until you collide with the coin.

## Lab 3
